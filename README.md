# Redmine Undev Watchers Plugin

This plugin makes selection of watchers easier and more convenient.

## Installation

*These installation instructions are based on Redmine 2.x. For instructions for previous versions, see [Redmine wiki](http://www.redmine.org/projects/redmine/wiki/Plugins).*

1. To install the plugin
    * Download the .ZIP archive, extract files and copy the plugin directory into #{REDMINE_ROOT}/plugins.
    
    Or

    * Change you current directory to your Redmine root directory:  

            cd {REDMINE_ROOT}
            
      Copy the plugin from GitHub using the following command:
      
            git clone https://github.com/Undev/redmine_undev_watchers.git plugins/redmine_undev_watchers
            
2. Install the required gems using the command:  

        bundle install  

    * In case of bundle install errors, remove the Gemfile.lock file, update the local package index and install the required dependencies. Then execute the bundle install command again:  

            rm Gemfile.lock
            sudo apt-get update
            sudo apt-get install -y libxml2-dev libxslt-dev libpq-dev
            bundle install
            
3. This plugin requires a migration. Run the following command to upgrade your database (make a database backup before):  

        bundle exec rake redmine:plugins:migrate RAILS_ENV=production

4. Restart Redmine.

Now you should be able to see the plugin in **Administration > Plugins**.
